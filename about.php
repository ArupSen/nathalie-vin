<h2>ABOUT</h2>

    <p>When not working on fixed commissions or client led designs, Nathalie is drawn to expressing philosophical notions, "permanence and impermanence, life and death, man versus nature, the future and our responses to it."</p>
    <p>There are undoubtedly recurrent themes in her work, an outcome of her innate instincts and interests. She is fascinated by the notion of the essential 'now', that ever-fleeting moment when entirety is glimpsed but never retained. She is intrigued by nature and how small our human concerns are in comparison to it.</p>
    <p>The concept of microcosm inside the macrocosm and how fragments are echoed and repeated to form the larger picture, embodies her work.</p>

    <p>Her fundamental activity is with fine art mosaics but her life and explorative curiousity informs her art, working with installation (perhaps the most monumental example of this is The Glow project), film, commissioned photographic documentaries for Holocaust Memorial day, sculpture and painting.</p>
    <p>Considering the process, Nathalies work investigates the small and how it builds into a larger whole. Whether she is making film, a mosaic piece or an installation she puts elements together like a puzzle. These could be mosaic tiles, wood elements, photographic or video images, memorabilia of people's lives, film footage etc.</p>

    <p>Nathalie Vin's practice has spanned the past 14 years, working now from her London based studio. She has been selected to exhibit in the most prestigious mosaic art exhibitions in the world and her work has been exhibited in musuems in France and the US. She was recently awarded with a 'special distinction' for the notorious Picasiette Prize in France.</p>
    <p>Nathalie is best known for her highly intricate work, intriguing and elegant designs and unusual techniques.</p>
