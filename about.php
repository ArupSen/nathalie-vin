    <p>Her fundamental activity is with fine art mosaics but her life and explorative curiousity informs her art, working with installation (perhaps the most monumental example of this is The Glow project), film, commissioned photographic documentaries for Holocaust Memorial day, sculpture and painting.</p>
    <p>Considering the process, Nathalies work investigates the small and how it builds into a larger whole. Whether she is making film, a mosaic piece or an installation she puts elements together like a puzzle. These could be mosaic tiles, wood elements, photographic or video images, memorabilia of people's lives, film footage etc.</p>
