# nathalie-vin
This is the dev cleanup branch which is the non-shop part of the website. The soft_launch branch is already up on nathalievin.com and now I can continue to work at cleaning up and tweaking what didn't go up on this branch and possibly merge it in later on.

#TODO list post launch
* Make the css into scss
* Filter out slideshow controls to a file
* Strip out extraneous code
* Add sign up form
* Mobile contact page
* Default meta tags
* Remove caroufredsel
